# Fitting_MoCap_Data

The code posted here tries to determine the values of the linear 2nd order differential equation approximation of the eequations of motion derived from the Lagrangian system. The Lagrangian
system, describes the proximal, middle and distal phalanges of the digits from the level of the metacarpophalangeal joints (Index through little finger) and from the level of the carpometacarpal joint
for the thumb. The kinematic chain is established as a linkage of compound rod pendulums with a constant density of 1.1 g/cm^3.
