# Distributon Fit of determined parameters

This code performs a distribution fit of either the normal or lognormal PDF on the determined parameters found in the Publication data excel file. The code checks whether the Shapiro-Wilk test p-value is greater than the 0.05 threshold for either PDF. If it is then it checks which p-value is bigger and fits the respective PDF on the data. From there a mean and a standard deviation for the PDF can be obtained.
