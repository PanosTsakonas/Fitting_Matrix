# Profile likelihood using the D2D software in MATLAB

To use this code you will need to have the D2D software installed in MATLAB. You can find the D2D software here (https://github.com/Data2Dynamics/d2d).
Once you have downloaded the software navigate to C:\......\arFramework3\Examples and create a new folder. Within that folder you will need to create a Data and a Models folders.
In the Data folder copy the New_data.def and the csv file New_data.csv. In the Models folder copy the IBK_rev.def file. Once everything is done then simply run the Profile_Likelihood_Fit_Comparison.m.
